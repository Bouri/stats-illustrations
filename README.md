# Thank you
Thank you to all the R developers, maintainers, contributors, teachers and communicators who actually MAKE all of these amazing packages and documentation for us to use! You're superheroes. When I create an illustration with your package it's with immense gratitude for how your hard work has allowed me to do mine (using and teaching #rstats) more efficiently, more clearly, more reproducibly....just plain better. My sincerest thanks.
