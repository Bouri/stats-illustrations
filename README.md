# First thing's first: 
Thank you to all the developers, maintainers, creators, contributors, and communicators who actually MAKE all of these amazing packages and documentation for us to use! You're superheroes! 

# The less important stuff:
This repo contains .png files for #rstats, data science and statistics illustrations from my twitter account (@allison_horst)
